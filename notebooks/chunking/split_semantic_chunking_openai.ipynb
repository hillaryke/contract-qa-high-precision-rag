(d) Confidential Information: any information disclosed by the Company to the Advisor and/or created as a result of the Services (including Work Product), of any type, form (including orally) or media, including (without limitation), code, specifications, architecture, design, data, algorithms, business plans, budget, customers / suppliers lists etc.), but excluding information which prior to the disclosure was publicly available or known to the Advisor (both without breach of any confidentiality obligation towards the Company). Use: The Advisor may use the Confidential Information only for the purpose of providing the Services and shall not obtain any rights in it. The Advisor shall stop using Confidential Information and/or return it to the Company and/or destroy it immediately upon Company’s request. The Advisor may disclose Confidential Information in case this is required by law, but only to the extent required and after providing the Company a prompt written notice and subject to promptly cooperate with the Company in seeking a protective order. Safeguard: The Advisor shall safeguard the Confidential Information, keep it in strict confidence and shall not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company. IP: Any Work Product, upon creation, shall be fully and exclusively owned by the Company. The Advisor, immediately upon Company’s request, shall sign any document and/or perform any action needed to formalize such ownership. The Advisor shall not obtain any rights in the Work Product, including moral rights and/or rights for royalties or other consideration under any applicable law (including Section 134 of the Israeli Patent Law – 1967 if applicable), and shall not be entitled to any compensation with respect to the Services, which was not specifically agreed, in writing, between the Advisor and the Company. Non-Compete: During the term of engagement with the Company and for a period of 12 months thereafter, Advisor shall not be involved, as an employee, owner, contractor or otherwise, in any business, which competes with the Company’s Business, and shall not solicit and/or hire any employee and/or service provider of the Company, without the prior written consent of the Company. Personnel: The Advisor may provide the Services only directly or through employees, contractors or agents (“Personnel”), which were specifically approved by the Company, and have committed in writing to confidentiality and ownership rights towards the Advisor and/or the Company, in a form restrictive enough to allow Advisor to comply and enforce the commitments under this undertaking (“Authorized Personnel”). Without limiting the foregoing, the Advisor is liable hereunder for any breach of this undertaking by any Advisor Personnel. Third Parties: The Advisor represents that the performance of the Services and the terms of this Undertaking, do not and will not breach any right, contractual or other, of any employer, customer or other third party. Advisor acknowledges that the Company is relying upon the truthfulness and accuracy of such representations in engaging with the Advisor. Advisor specifically undertakes not to use any proprietary and/or confidential information belonging to the Advisor and/or any third party while performing the Services and in case any Advisor proprietary or confidential information is used, such information will be automatically assigned to the Company and become its full and exclusive property. Jurisdiction: This Undertaking shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without giving effect to its laws pertaining to conflict of laws. The Advisor agrees that any and all disputes in connection with this Undertaking shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. Pre-Undertaking: In case the Advisor has been providing Services to the Company before the Effective Date (“Pre-Undertaking Period”), this Undertaking shall also apply to the Pre-Undertaking Period, including, if relevant, before Company’s incorporation. The Company may assign this undertaking to third parties.\n"
